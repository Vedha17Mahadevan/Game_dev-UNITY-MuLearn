## 📝 First Impressions

My initial experience with Unity6 has been smooth and nice. The interface seems to be well structured and clean making the navigation easy. 

In the Scene View, a cube has been placed along the center with default camera abd Directional Light. At the bottom, the Project Window displays asset folders like Scenes, Settings, and InputSystem. The layout shows a standard Unity workspace ready for development.

Unity feels powerful yet friendly — I’m excited to explore more.
